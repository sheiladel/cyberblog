What is cybersecurity?<br>
I recently watched the movie Hackers, a film from the '90s featuring Angelina Jolie. The group of hackers appeared to be individuals ahead of their time- they had to have an extensive knowledge and deep understanding of information technology and computer science as they worked quickly and made their tasks look simple. Fast forward to today in 2024 where I am fortunate, excited, and overwhelmed learning about cybersecurity now. I have learned that cybersecurity is, simply put, assessing threats and mitigating risk. In other words, cybersecurity is understanding how to properly protect our devices and networks and data from cybercriminals. Cybercrime is everywhere- text messages, social media apps, dating apps, even livestreams and video games! For example, I had never head of the term 'doxxing' until I was threatened by an unpleasant player in a game. Doxxing refers to exposing information or data for misuse or exploitation. Overall, the number of cases in cybercrime is increasing, and so it is our job as cybersecurity professionals to not only protect and secure our devices, networks, and data, but also educate everyone about defending against cybercrime, especially our elders who are at higher risk of attack. This is just the beginning of my journey into cybersecurity, and I look forward to more breakthrough 'aha!' moments.
