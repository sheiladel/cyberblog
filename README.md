Hi, I'm Sheila. After 10 years of educating people about healthy nutrition habits and effective exercise techniques, I am transitioning into the world of cybersecurity. Thank you for being here.

<h1>What is Cybersecurity?</h1>
I recently watched the movie Hackers, a film from the '90s featuring Angelina Jolie. The group of hackers appeared to be individuals ahead of their time- they had to have an extensive knowledge and deep understanding of information technology and computer science as they worked quickly and made their tasks look simple. Fast forward to today in 2024 where I am fortunate, excited, and overwhelmed learning about cybersecurity now. I have learned that cybersecurity is, simply put, assessing threats and mitigating risk. In other words, cybersecurity is understanding how to properly protect our devices and networks and data from cybercriminals. Cybercrime is everywhere- text messages, social media apps, dating apps, even livestreams and video games! For example, I had never head of the term 'doxxing' until I was threatened by an unpleasant player in a game. Doxxing refers to exposing information or data for misuse or exploitation. Overall, the number of cases in cybercrime is increasing, and so it is our job as cybersecurity professionals to not only protect and secure our devices, networks, and data, but also educate everyone about defending against cybercrime, especially our elders who are at higher risk of attack. This is just the beginning of my journey into cybersecurity, and I look forward to more breakthrough 'aha!' moments.

<h1>How to Spot Fake Messages</h1>
It is nearly impossible to go about our day without using our smartphones to communicate with family, colleagues, coworkers, and friends. Unfortunately, our increased use of technology leads to the increase of opportunity for cybercriminals to attack through our smartphones.

I can't say how many times I've received a screenshot from my mom asking if the messages she receives are legit. Why would a random person send prize money? How could she win a prize for a contest she never entered? If you have to wonder if something is legit, it probably is not legit.

How can we teach our parents and grandparents to protect themselves from phishing attacks?

Pay attention to who the sender is. If it is from an unknown number or email, it is suspicious. 

Pay attention to the links. If you have any uncertainty, do not click it! If there is any language appealing to your excitement, it is suspicious.

Pay attenion to the spelling and grammar. If you see any typos from a message claiming to be a big business name, it is suspicious.

Let's continue to teach each other best practices for defending against cybercrime.
